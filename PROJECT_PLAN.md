# Meta-Analysis 101 — Project Plan & Strategy

## Overview
An interactive bilingual (ZH/EN) educational website teaching meta-analysis from beginner to advanced. Built with React, using a shared i18n system and hash-based routing between courses. Each course ends with a unique mini-game (2-3 min) to reinforce learning.

## Teaching Schedule
- **Hour 1:** Courses 0–3 (Planning & Preparation)
- **Hour 2:** Courses 4–5 (Analysis & Interpretation)
- Games are kept short (2-3 min each) for live classroom use

## Course 1 Details (PICO)

### Sections (in order):
1. **Why PICO?** — Bad vs good question comparison
2. **PICO Elements** — 4 interactive cards (P, I, C, O) in 2×2 grid
3. **PICOS Extension** — The S (Study design) element
4. **Common Mistakes** — 5 PICO traps (bad/good comparison cards)
5. **Interactive PICO Builder** — Multiple-choice: pick best P, I, C, O for 3 scenarios (Cardiology/Infectious Disease/Psychiatry)
6. **Dino Egg Hatch Game** — Pick 1 of 7 eggs → 7 questions drawn from 70-question bank (balanced across 7 categories) → 5 correct = hatch dinosaur with sun particles, 3 wrong = freeze with snowflake particles
7. **AI PICO Workshop** — Pick scenario, write free-text PICO, AI gives inline feedback per field + overall assessment

### Game Mechanics (Dino Egg Hatch):
- Standalone component in `DinoEggHatch.jsx`, imported by `Course1.jsx` (same pattern as Course 2's DinoFoodRescue)
- Also exports `DragonEgg` SVG component (named export) used decoratively in Course1 hero section
- 70-question bank in `questionBank.js` (`course1Questions`), 10 per category × 7 categories:
  - Cat 0: Identifying correct PICO format
  - Cat 1: Population (P) — specificity & scope
  - Cat 2: Intervention (I) — defining the treatment
  - Cat 3: Comparison (C) — choosing comparators
  - Cat 4: Outcome (O) — measurable endpoints
  - Cat 5: PICOS & Study design (S)
  - Cat 6: Common mistakes & pitfalls
- `pickBalanced()` helper draws 7 questions evenly across categories, then shuffles
- Each playthrough gets different questions — high replayability
- 7 eggs with unique colors matching Course 0's palette: `#2ECC71, #3498DB, #F1C40F, #E74C3C, #9B59B6, #E67E22, #95A5A6`
- 7 dinosaur names (zh): 翠牙龍, 蒼瀾龍, 金翼龍, 焰角龍, 紫棘龍, 珀爪龍, 鐵穹龍
- 7 dinosaur names (en): Rex, Azure, Zephyr, Blaze, Thistle, Velo, Dome
- Correct → ☀️ sun particles fall + warm golden glow grows around egg
- Wrong → ❄️ snowflake particles fall + frost blue glow grows around egg
- Progress shown as: 5 sun circles ○○○○○ | 3 ice circles ○○○

### Known Issues:
- **AI Workshop doesn't work** — Anthropic API requires authentication. Needs a backend proxy (e.g., Vercel/Netlify serverless function) to hide API key. Same issue in Course 2's AI section.
- Emoji rendering: some newer Unicode emojis (🫀🦠🧠) don't render on all systems. Use older, safer alternatives.

## Course 2 Details (Literature Search & PRISMA)

### Sections:
1. **Why Systematic Search?** — Random vs systematic comparison
2. **Database Overview** — PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, WoS, CINAHL, Grey literature
3. **Boolean Operators** — AND/OR/NOT with interactive Venn diagrams
4. **PRISMA Flow Diagram** — Interactive visualization
5. **Screening Tips** — 4 practical tips
6. **Dino Food Rescue Game** — Pick 1 of 7 dinos → 7 shuffled questions → crack ice cubes with pickaxe to free food
7. **AI Search Strategy Workshop** — Same API issue as Course 1

### Game Mechanics (Dino Food Rescue):
- Standalone component in `DinoFoodRescue.jsx`, imported by `Course2.jsx`
- Pick 1 of 7 dinos → each has species-matched food trapped in ice cubes
- 70-question bank in `questionBank.js` (`course2Questions`), 10 per category × 7 categories:
  - Cat 0: Systematic vs casual search
  - Cat 1: Databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, etc.)
  - Cat 2: Boolean operators & search syntax (AND, OR, NOT, MeSH, truncation)
  - Cat 3: PRISMA flow diagram
  - Cat 4: Screening process
  - Cat 5: Grey literature & search completeness
  - Cat 6: Search strategy pitfalls & best practices
- 7 questions drawn per playthrough via `pickBalanced()` — different each time
- Old i18n keys (`c2gq1`–`c2gq7`) to be replaced with questionBank import (same pattern as Course 1)
- Correct → pickaxe swing animation → ice crack lines grow → ice shatters into particles → food pops out → dino bounces happily
- Wrong → pickaxe bounces off → ice shakes → explanation shown → "Swing Again" retry button (second chance)
- Score tracks first-try correct count; all food is always eventually rescued
- Progress bar: 7 ice cube icons, each replaced by ✅ when freed
- Dino reactions: happy bounce (correct), sad shake (wrong), eating animation (food freed)
- Species-matched food: Rex→🍖, Azure→🐟, Zephyr→🦐, Blaze→🌿, Thistle→🌱, Velo→🥚, Dome→🍄
- Results screen: tiered message (master ≥6, good ≥4, learning <4), dino with all freed food displayed
- Bilingual UI strings handled internally (no new i18n keys needed)

### TODO:
- Wire `DinoFoodRescue.jsx` to use `questionBank.js` (replace `c2gq*` i18n loop with `course2Questions` import + `pickBalanced`)
- Remove old `c2gq*` keys from `i18n.js` after wiring
- Fix AI workshop (backend proxy issue)

## Design System

### Colors:
- TEAL: `#0E7C86` (primary, Course 0)
- CORAL: `#E8734A` (accent, Course 1)
- PURPLE: `#7B68C8` (Course 2 accent)
- GOLD: `#D4A843` (Course 3 accent)
- DARK: `#1D2B3A` (text)
- LIGHT_BG: `#F8F7F4` (background)
- MUTED: `#6B7A8D` (secondary text)
- LIGHT_BORDER: `#E8E6E1`

### Fonts:
- Headings: 'Noto Sans TC', 'Source Serif 4', serif
- Body: 'Noto Sans TC', 'Outfit', sans-serif

### Shared Components:
- `FadeIn` — Intersection observer scroll animation
- `SectionLabel` — Uppercase colored label with line
- `SectionTitle` — Responsive heading
- `Paragraph` — Styled body text
- `CuteDino` — 7 unique dinosaur SVGs (T-Rex, Plesiosaur, Pterodactyl, Triceratops, Stegosaurus, Velociraptor, Pachycephalosaurus)
- `DragonEgg` — SVG egg with states: idle, crack, frozen (lives in `DinoEggHatch.jsx`, exported as named export)

### i18n Pattern:
- All keys prefixed by course: `c1` for Course 1, `c2` for Course 2, `c3` for Course 3
- Template literals like `` t(`c1trap${n}Title`) `` need the prefix inside the backtick
- Function values (e.g., gameQ, gameScore) use `t("key", arg)` NOT `t("key")(arg)`
- Hub keys use `hub` prefix
- **Game questions are NOT in i18n.js** — they live in `questionBank.js` with bilingual text embedded per question object

## Course 3 Details (Data Extraction & Risk of Bias)

### Sections (in order):
1. **Why Data Extraction Matters** — Opening hook: "reading the nutrition label, not just the food packaging." Bad example (grabbing only p-values from abstracts) vs good example (structured extraction of events, sample sizes, means, SDs). Emphasizes garbage-in-garbage-out.
2. **The Extraction Table** — Interactive demo of a standardized data extraction form. 8 clickable columns: Author/Year, Study Design, Population (n), Intervention details, Comparator, Outcome definition, Results (raw numbers), Notes. Click each to see what goes in it with example data. Cooking analogy: "measuring each ingredient precisely before adding it to the pot."
3. **What Numbers to Extract** — Two clickable tracks side by side: (a) Dichotomous outcomes → events + totals per group (e.g., 15/100 vs 22/100), and (b) Continuous outcomes → mean, SD, n per group. Also covers: what to do when studies report medians/IQR (Wan/Luo conversion formulas), and handling zero events (continuity corrections).
4. **Risk of Bias: Why Quality Matters** — Analogy: "checking freshness of ingredients before cooking." Concept that not all included studies are trustworthy. Cooking analogy: one spoiled ingredient ruins the whole pot → sensitivity analysis.
5. **RoB Tools** — Two interactive cards: (a) Cochrane RoB 2 for RCTs — the 5 domains (randomization, deviations from intended intervention, missing outcome data, outcome measurement, selective reporting) shown as traffic-light levels (low/some concerns/high risk). (b) Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies — the 3 categories (selection, comparability, outcome) with star ratings. Click each card to expand details.
6. **Putting It Together** — Interactive traffic-light matrix for 5 example studies, with a "sensitivity analysis" toggle button that excludes the high-risk study and shows the pooled estimate change. Reinforces: two independent extractors, resolve disagreements, document everything.
7. **Dino Home Save Game** — Pick 1 of 7 dinos → 7 questions → 10s timer → keep the fireplace burning

### Game Mechanics (Dino Home Save):
- Standalone component in `DinoHomeSave.jsx`, imported by `Course3.jsx`
- Pick 1 of 7 dinos → each needs to keep their home warm during a blizzard
- 70-question bank in `questionBank.js` (`course3Questions`), 10 per category × 7 categories:
  - Cat 0: Purpose and principles of data extraction
  - Cat 1: What to extract for dichotomous outcomes
  - Cat 2: What to extract for continuous outcomes + conversions (median→mean)
  - Cat 3: Cochrane RoB 2 domains
  - Cat 4: Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for observational studies
  - Cat 5: Dual extraction, disagreement resolution, and error prevention
  - Cat 6: Sensitivity analysis and handling problematic studies
- 7 questions drawn per playthrough via `pickBalanced()` — different each time
- **10-second timer** per question — snow keeps falling while timer counts down
- Correct → fire in fireplace grows larger and brighter, dino warms up, background shifts to warm tones
- Wrong/Timeout → fire dims, dino shivers, more snow falls, background shifts to cold tones
- **Win condition:** 5 correct answers → home saved! (roaring fire, happy dino)
- **Lose condition:** 3 wrong/timeout → home frozen (fire out, sad dino, ice overlay)
- No second chances (unlike Course 2) — the timer pressure is the difficulty mechanic
- Progress shown as: 5 fire circles 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 | 3 ice circles ❄❄❄
- SVG animated fireplace with flickering flames (5 intensity levels)
- Falling snow particles with intensity proportional to fire weakness
- Background color transitions: warm gold (fire strong) → cold blue (fire weak)
- Bilingual UI strings handled internally (no new i18n keys needed for game — all in-component)
- `course3Categories` exported from `questionBank.js` for reference

### Interactive Components:
- **ExtractionTableDemo** — 8 clickable column cards, detail panel shows description + example data
- **OutcomeTracksDemo** — Dichotomous vs Continuous toggle cards with extraction format details
- **RoBToolCards** — Two expandable cards: RoB 2 (5 domains, traffic-light levels) and NOS (3 categories, star system)
- **TrafficLightDemo** — 5-study matrix with colored dots, sensitivity analysis toggle button that excludes high-risk study and updates pooled effect live

## Technical Notes

### Adding a New Course:
1. Create `CourseN.jsx` with teaching sections + AI workshop
2. Create game as standalone component (e.g., `DinoGameN.jsx`) — import by CourseN
3. Add 70 bilingual questions to `questionBank.js` as `courseNQuestions` (10 per category × 7 categories)
4. Add translations to `i18n.js` with `cN` prefix (UI strings only — game questions stay in questionBank)
5. Add route in `App.jsx` switch statement
6. Add course card in `App.jsx` CourseHub courses array
7. Update hub status from "coming" to "available"

### Question Bank Architecture (`questionBank.js`):
- Centralized file for all course game questions — no questions in i18n.js
- Each question: `{ id, category, zh: { q, opts, exp }, en: { q, opts, exp }, correct }`
- `id` format: `"cN-XXX"` (e.g., `"c1-042"`, `"c2-015"`)
- `category` (0–6) maps to 7 thematic groups per course
- Helper functions exported:
  - `pickQuestions(pool, n)` — pure random pick
  - `pickBalanced(pool, n, numCategories)` — even coverage across categories, then shuffle
- Game components localize at runtime: `q[lang].q`, `q[lang].opts`, `q.correct`, `q[lang].exp`
- Currently: 210 questions total (70 Course 1 PICO + 70 Course 2 Literature Search + 70 Course 3 Data Extraction & RoB)

### Common Pitfalls:
- Template literal translation keys MUST include prefix: `` t(`c1scenario${s}`) `` not `` t(`scenario${s}`) ``
- Function translation values: use `t("key", arg)` not `t("key")(arg)`
- Test emoji rendering across systems — prefer pre-2020 Unicode
- AI features need backend proxy for API key — currently broken in browser

### Backend TODO (for AI features):
- Need a serverless function (Vercel/Netlify) that:
  1. Receives PICO text from frontend
  2. Calls Anthropic API with hidden API key
  3. Returns AI feedback to frontend
- Affects: Course 1 AI Workshop, Course 2 AI Workshop
- Note: Course 3 does not have an AI workshop section (teaching content is self-contained with interactive demos)

### Backend Status (Supabase Integration):
- See `BACKEND_UPGRADE_PLAN.md` for full details
- **Supabase project:** `meta-analysis-101` at `https://souaycpzgabrxdwvqpmq.supabase.co`
- **Auth:** Google OAuth configured and working (login/logout tested locally)
- **Database:** `profiles` and `progress` tables created with RLS policies + auto-profile trigger
- **Frontend wiring:** `supabaseClient.js` created, `App.jsx` updated with auth state + login UI in CourseHub nav bar
- **Next:** Wire progress saving into game components (Phase 3), then build Progress Dashboard (Phase 4)
